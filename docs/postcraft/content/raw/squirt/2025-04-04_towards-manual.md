# Squirt towards manual

It *should* just work by pointing a HTTP server at `public`.

how would an app like squirt be converter into a PWA?

Whereabouts are the views listed? 


I would like to add another view to Squirt , it will need to address the same endpoints for data and use the same settings panel, maybe other parts of the common code. But it should be more like a plugin than part of Squirt
