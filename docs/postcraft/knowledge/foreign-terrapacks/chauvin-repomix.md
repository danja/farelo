File Summary
================================================================

Purpose:
--------
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

File Format:
------------
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Repository structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A separator line (================)
  b. The file path (File: path/to/file)
  c. Another separator line
  d. The full contents of the file
  e. A blank line

Usage Guidelines:
-----------------
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

Notes:
------
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repopack's
  configuration.
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to
  the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including
  binary files.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) follows a client-host-server architecture where each host can run multiple client instances. This architecture enables users to integrate AI capabilities across applications while maintaining clear security boundaries and isolating concerns. Built on JSON-RPC, MCP provides a stateful session protocol focused on context exchange and sampling coordination between clients and servers.

## Core Components

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Application Host Process"
        H[Host]
        C1[Client 1]
        C2[Client 2]
        C3[Client 3]
        H --> C1
        H --> C2
        H --> C3
    end

    subgraph "Local machine"
        S1[Server 1<br>Files & Git]
        S2[Server 2<br>Database]
        R1[("Local<br>Resource A")]
        R2[("Local<br>Resource B")]

        C1 --> S1
        C2 --> S2
        S1 <--> R1
        S2 <--> R2
    end

    subgraph "Internet"
        S3[Server 3<br>External APIs]
        R3[("Remote<br>Resource C")]

        C3 --> S3
        S3 <--> R3
    end
```

### Host
The host process acts as the container and coordinator:
- Creates and manages multiple client instances
- Controls client connection permissions and lifecycle
- Enforces security policies and consent requirements
- Handles user authorization decisions
- Coordinates AI/LLM integration and sampling
- Manages context aggregation across clients

### Clients
Each client is created by the host and maintains an isolated server connection:
- Establishes one stateful session per server
- Handles protocol negotiation and capability exchange
- Routes protocol messages bidirectionally
- Manages subscriptions and notifications
- Maintains security boundaries between servers

A host application creates and manages multiple clients, with each client having a 1:1 relationship with a particular server.

### Servers
Servers provide specialized context and capabilities:
- Expose resources, tools and prompts via MCP primitives
- Operate independently with focused responsibilities
- Request sampling through client interfaces
- Must respect security constraints
- Can be local processes or remote services

## Design Principles

MCP is built on several key design principles that inform its architecture and implementation:

1. **Servers should be extremely easy to build**
    - Host applications handle complex orchestration responsibilities
    - Servers focus on specific, well-defined capabilities
    - Simple interfaces minimize implementation overhead
    - Clear separation enables maintainable code

2. **Servers should be highly composable**
    - Each server provides focused functionality in isolation
    - Multiple servers can be combined seamlessly
    - Shared protocol enables interoperability
    - Modular design supports extensibility

3. **Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation, nor "see into" other servers**
    - Servers receive only necessary contextual information
    - Full conversation history stays with the host
    - Each server connection maintains isolation
    - Cross-server interactions are controlled by the host
    - Host process enforces security boundaries

4. **Features can be added to servers and clients progressively**
    - Core protocol provides minimal required functionality
    - Additional capabilities can be negotiated as needed
    - Servers and clients evolve independently
    - Protocol designed for future extensibility
    - Backwards compatibility is maintained

## Message Types
MCP defines three core message types based on [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification):

- **Requests**: Bidirectional messages with method and parameters expecting a response
- **Responses**: Successful results or errors matching specific request IDs
- **Notifications**: One-way messages requiring no response

Each message type follows the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification for structure and delivery semantics.

## Capability Negotiation

The Model Context Protocol uses a capability-based negotiation system where clients and servers explicitly declare their supported features during initialization. Capabilities determine which protocol features and primitives are available during a session.

- Servers declare capabilities like resource subscriptions, tool support, and prompt templates
- Clients declare capabilities like sampling support and notification handling
- Both parties must respect declared capabilities throughout the session
- Additional capabilities can be negotiated through extensions to the protocol

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Host
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Host->>+Client: Initialize client
    Client->>+Server: Initialize session with capabilities
    Server-->>Client: Respond with supported capabilities

    Note over Host,Server: Active Session with Negotiated Features

    loop Client Requests
        Host->>Client: User- or model-initiated action
        Client->>Server: Request (tools/resources)
        Server-->>Client: Response
        Client-->>Host: Update UI or respond to model
    end

    loop Server Requests
        Server->>Client: Request (sampling)
        Client->>Host: Forward to AI
        Host-->>Client: AI response
        Client-->>Server: Response
    end

    loop Notifications
        Server--)Client: Resource updates
        Client--)Server: Status changes
    end

    Host->>Client: Terminate
    Client->>-Server: End session
    deactivate Server
```

Each capability unlocks specific protocol features for use during the session. For example:
- Implemented [server features]({{< ref "/specification/server" >}}) must be advertised in the server's capabilities
- Emitting resource subscription notifications requires the server to declare subscription support
- Tool invocation requires the server to declare tool capabilities
- [Sampling]({{< ref "/specification/client" >}}) requires the client to declare support in its capabilities

This capability negotiation ensures clients and servers have a clear understanding of supported functionality while maintaining protocol extensibility.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) supports optional cancellation of in-progress requests through notification messages. Either side can send a cancellation notification to indicate that a previously-issued request should be terminated.

## Cancellation Flow

When a party wants to cancel an in-progress request, it sends a `notifications/cancelled` notification containing:

- The ID of the request to cancel
- An optional reason string that can be logged or displayed

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/cancelled",
  "params": {
    "requestId": "123",
    "reason": "User requested cancellation"
  }
}
```

## Behavior Requirements

1. Cancellation notifications **MUST** only reference requests that:
   - Were previously issued in the same direction
   - Are believed to still be in-progress
2. The `initialize` request **MUST NOT** be cancelled by clients
3. Receivers of cancellation notifications **SHOULD**:
   - Stop processing the cancelled request
   - Free associated resources
   - Not send a response for the cancelled request
4. Receivers **MAY** ignore cancellation notifications if:
   - The referenced request is unknown
   - Processing has already completed
   - The request cannot be cancelled
5. The sender of the cancellation notification **SHOULD** ignore any response to the request that arrives afterward

## Timing Considerations

Due to network latency, cancellation notifications may arrive after request processing has completed, and potentially after a response has already been sent.

Both parties **MUST** handle these race conditions gracefully:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   participant Client
   participant Server

   Client->>Server: Request (ID: 123)
   Note over Server: Processing starts
   Client--)Server: notifications/cancelled (ID: 123)
   alt 
      Note over Server: Processing may have<br/>completed before<br/>cancellation arrives
   else If not completed
      Note over Server: Stop processing
   end
```

## Implementation Notes

- Both parties **SHOULD** log cancellation reasons for debugging
- Application UIs **SHOULD** indicate when cancellation is requested

## Error Handling

Invalid cancellation notifications **SHOULD** be ignored:

- Unknown request IDs
- Already completed requests
- Malformed notifications

This maintains the "fire and forget" nature of notifications while allowing for race conditions in asynchronous communication.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol includes an optional ping mechanism that allows either party to verify that their counterpart is still responsive and the connection is alive.

## Overview

The ping functionality is implemented through a simple request/response pattern. Either the client or server can initiate a ping by sending a `ping` request.

## Message Format

A ping request is a standard JSON-RPC request with no parameters:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "123",
  "method": "ping"
}
```

## Behavior Requirements

1. The receiver **MUST** respond promptly with an empty response:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "123",
  "result": {}
}
```

2. If no response is received within a reasonable timeout period, the sender **MAY**:
   - Consider the connection stale
   - Terminate the connection
   - Attempt reconnection procedures

## Usage Patterns

## Implementation Considerations

- Implementations **SHOULD** periodically issue pings to detect connection health
- The frequency of pings **SHOULD** be configurable
- Timeouts **SHOULD** be appropriate for the network environment
- Excessive pinging **SHOULD** be avoided to reduce network overhead

## Error Handling

- Timeouts **SHOULD** be treated as connection failures
- Multiple failed pings **MAY** trigger connection reset
- Implementations **SHOULD** log ping failures for diagnostics

**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) supports optional progress tracking for long-running operations through notification messages. Either side can send progress notifications to provide updates about operation status.

## Progress Flow

When a party wants to _receive_ progress updates for a request, it includes a `progressToken` in the request metadata.

* Progress tokens **MUST** be a string or integer value
* Progress tokens can be chosen by the sender using any means, but **MUST** be unique across all active requests.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "some_method",
  "params": {
    "_meta": {
      "progressToken": "abc123"
    }
  }
}
```

The receiver **MAY** then send progress notifications containing:

- The original progress token
- The current progress value so far
- An optional "total" value

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "abc123",
    "progress": 50,
    "total": 100
  }
}
```

* The `progress` value **MUST** increase with each notification, even if the total is unknown.
* The `progress` and the `total` values **MAY** be floating point.

## Behavior Requirements

1. Progress notifications **MUST** only reference tokens that:
   - Were provided in an active request
   - Are associated with an in-progress operation

2. Receivers of progress requests **MAY**:
   - Choose not to send any progress notifications
   - Send notifications at whatever frequency they deem appropriate
   - Omit the total value if unknown

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sender
    participant Receiver

    Note over Sender,Receiver: Request with progress token
    Sender->>Receiver: Method request with progressToken

    Note over Sender,Receiver: Progress updates
    loop Progress Updates
        Receiver-->>Sender: Progress notification (0.2/1.0)
        Receiver-->>Sender: Progress notification (0.6/1.0)
        Receiver-->>Sender: Progress notification (1.0/1.0)
    end

    Note over Sender,Receiver: Operation complete
    Receiver->>Sender: Method response
```

## Implementation Notes

- Senders and receivers **SHOULD** track active progress tokens
- Both parties **SHOULD** implement rate limiting to prevent flooding
- Progress notifications **MUST** stop after completion

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

All messages between MCP clients and servers **MUST** follow the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification. The protocol defines three fundamental types of messages:

| Type           | Description                            | Requirements                           |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Requests`     | Messages sent to initiate an operation | Must include unique ID and method name |
| `Responses`    | Messages sent in reply to requests     | Must include same ID as request        |
| `Notifications`| One-way messages with no reply         | Must not include an ID                 |

**Responses** are further sub-categorized as either **successful results** or **errors**. Results can follow any JSON object structure, while errors must include an error code and message at minimum.

## Protocol Layers

The Model Context Protocol consists of several key components that work together:

- **Base Protocol**: Core JSON-RPC message types
- **Lifecycle Management**: Connection initialization, capability negotiation, and session control
- **Server Features**: Resources, prompts, and tools exposed by servers
- **Client Features**: Sampling and root directory lists provided by clients
- **Utilities**: Cross-cutting concerns like logging and argument completion

All implementations **MUST** support the base protocol and lifecycle management components. Other components **MAY** be implemented based on the specific needs of the application.

These protocol layers establish clear separation of concerns while enabling rich interactions between clients and servers. The modular design allows implementations to support exactly the features they need.

See the following pages for more details on the different components:

## Auth

Authentication and authorization are not currently part of the core MCP specification, but we are considering ways to introduce them in future. Join us in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/discussions) to help shape the future of the protocol!

Clients and servers **MAY** negotiate their own custom authentication and authorization strategies.

## Schema

The full specification of the protocol is defined as a [TypeScript schema](http://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/schema/schema.ts). This is the source of truth for all protocol messages and structures.

There is also a [JSON Schema](http://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/schema/schema.json), which is automatically generated from the TypeScript source of truth, for use with various automated tooling.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a rigorous lifecycle for client-server connections that ensures proper capability negotiation and state management.

1. **Initialization**: Capability negotiation and protocol version agreement
2. **Operation**: Normal protocol communication
3. **Shutdown**: Graceful termination of the connection

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Note over Client,Server: Initialization Phase

    end

    Note over Client,Server: Shutdown
    Client--)-Server: Disconnect
    deactivate Server
    Note over Client,Server: Connection closed
```

## Lifecycle Phases

### Initialization

The initialization phase **MUST** be the first interaction between client and server. During this phase, the client and server:

- Establish protocol version compatibility
- Exchange and negotiate capabilities
- Share implementation details

The client **MUST** initiate this phase by sending an `initialize` request containing:

- Protocol version supported
- Client capabilities
- Client implementation information

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "roots": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "sampling": {}
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleClient",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The server **MUST** respond with its own capabilities and information:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "logging": {},
      "prompts": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "resources": {
        "subscribe": true,
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "tools": {
        "listChanged": true
      }
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleServer",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

After successful initialization, the client **MUST** send an `initialized` notification to indicate it is ready to begin normal operations:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "initialized"
}
```

* The client **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than [pings]({{< ref "/specification/basic/utilities/ping" >}}) before the server has responded to the `initialize` request.
* The server **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than [pings]({{< ref "/specification/basic/utilities/ping" >}}) and [logging]({{< ref "/specification/server/utilities/logging" >}}) before receiving the `initialized` notification.

#### Version Negotiation

In the `initialize` request, the client **MUST** send a protocol version it supports. This **SHOULD** be the _latest_ version supported by the client.

If the server supports the requested protocol version, it **MUST** respond with the same version. Otherwise, the server **MUST** respond with another protocol version it supports. This **SHOULD** be the _latest_ version supported by the server.

If the client does not support the version in the server's response, it **SHOULD** disconnect.

#### Capability Negotiation

Client and server capabilities establish which optional protocol features will be available during the session.

Key capabilities include:

| Category | Capability     | Description |
|----------|--------------- |-------------|
| Client   | `roots`        | Ability to provide filesystem [roots]({{< ref "/specification/client/roots" >}}) |
| Client   | `sampling`     | Support for LLM [sampling]({{< ref "/specification/client/sampling" >}}) requests |
| Client   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features |
| Server   | `prompts`      | Offers [prompt templates]({{< ref "/specification/server/prompts" >}}) |
| Server   | `resources`    | Provides readable [resources]({{< ref "/specification/server/resources" >}}) |
| Server   | `tools`        | Exposes callable [tools]({{< ref "/specification/server/tools" >}}) |
| Server   | `logging`      | Emits structured [log messages]({{< ref "/specification/server/utilities/logging" >}}) |
| Server   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features |

Capability objects can describe sub-capabilities like:
- `listChanged`: Support for list change notifications (for prompts, resources, and tools)
- `subscribe`: Support for subscribing to individual items' changes (resources only)

### Operation

During the operation phase, the client and server exchange messages according to the negotiated capabilities.

Both parties **SHOULD**:

- Respect the negotiated protocol version
- Only use capabilities that were successfully negotiated

### Shutdown

During the shutdown phase, one side (usually the client) cleanly terminates the protocol connection. No specific shutdown messages are defined—instead, the underlying transport mechanism should be used to signal connection termination:

#### stdio

For the stdio [transport]({{< ref "/specification/basic/transports" >}}), the client **SHOULD** initiate shutdown by:

1. First, closing the input stream to the child process (the server)
2. Waiting for the server to exit, or sending `SIGTERM` if the server does not exit within a reasonable time
3. Sending `SIGKILL` if the server does not exit within a reasonable time after `SIGTERM`

The server **MAY** initiate shutdown by closing its output stream to the client and exiting.

#### HTTP

For HTTP [transports]({{< ref "/specification/basic/transports" >}}), shutdown is indicated by closing the associated HTTP connection(s).

## Error Handling

Implementations **SHOULD** be prepared to handle these error cases:

- Protocol version mismatch
- Failure to negotiate required capabilities
- Initialize request timeout
- Shutdown timeout

Implementations **SHOULD** implement appropriate timeouts for all requests, to prevent hung connections and resource exhaustion.

Example initialization error:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Unsupported protocol version",
    "data": {
      "supported": ["2024-11-05"],
      "requested": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

All messages in MCP **MUST** follow the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) specification. The protocol defines three types of messages:

## Requests

Requests are sent from the client to the server or vice versa.

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id: string | number;
  method: string;
  params?: {
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
}
```

* Requests **MUST** include a string or integer ID.
* Unlike base JSON-RPC, the ID **MUST NOT** be `null`.
* The request ID **MUST NOT** have been previously used by the requestor within the same session.

## Responses

Responses are sent in reply to requests.

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id: string | number;
  result?: {
    [key: string]: unknown;
  }
  error?: {
    code: number;
    message: string;
    data?: unknown;
  }
}
```

* Responses **MUST** include the same ID as the request they correspond to.
* Either a `result` or an `error` **MUST** be set. A response **MUST NOT** set both.
* Error codes **MUST** be integers.

## Notifications

Notifications are sent from the client to the server or vice versa. They do not expect a response.

```typescript
{
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: string;
  params?: {
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
}
```

* Notifications **MUST NOT** include an ID.

title: Transports

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

MCP currently defines two standard transport mechanisms for client-server communication:
1. [stdio](#stdio), communication over standard in and standard out
2. [HTTP with Server-Sent Events](#http-with-sse) (SSE)

Clients **SHOULD** support stdio whenever possible.

It is also possible for clients and servers to implement [custom transports](#custom-transports) in a pluggable fashion.

## stdio
In the **stdio** transport:
* The client launches the MCP server as a subprocess.
* The server receives JSON-RPC messages on its standard input (`stdin`) and writes responses to its standard output (`stdout`).
* Messages are delimited by newlines, and **MUST NOT** contain embedded newlines.
* The server **MAY** write UTF-8 strings to its standard error (`stderr`) for logging purposes. Clients **MAY** capture, forward, or ignore this logging.
* The server **MUST NOT** write anything to its `stdout` that is not a valid MCP message.
* The client **MUST NOT** write anything to the server's `stdin` that is not a valid MCP message.

    participant Server Process

    Client->>+Server Process: Launch subprocess
    loop Message Exchange
        Client->>Server Process: Write to stdin
        Server Process->>Client: Write to stdout
        Server Process--)Client: Optional logs on stderr
    end
    Client->>Server Process: Close stdin, terminate subprocess
    deactivate Server Process
```

## HTTP with SSE
In the **SSE** transport, the server operates as an independent process that can handle multiple client connections.

The server **MUST** provide two endpoints:

1. An SSE endpoint, for clients to establish a connection and receive messages from the server
2. A regular HTTP POST endpoint for clients to send messages to the server

When a client connects, the server **MUST** send an `endpoint` event containing a URI for the client to use for sending messages. All subsequent client messages **MUST** be sent as HTTP POST requests to this endpoint.

Server messages are sent as SSE `message` events, with the message content encoded as JSON in the event data.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: Open SSE connection
    Server->>Client: endpoint event
    loop Message Exchange
        Client->>Server: HTTP POST messages
        Server->>Client: SSE message events
    end
    Client->>Server: Close SSE connection
```

## Custom Transports

Clients and servers **MAY** implement additional custom transport mechanisms to suit their specific needs. The protocol is transport-agnostic and can be implemented over any communication channel that supports bidirectional message exchange.

Implementers who choose to support custom transports **MUST** ensure they preserve the JSON-RPC message format and lifecycle requirements defined by MCP. Custom transports **SHOULD** document their specific connection establishment and message exchange patterns to aid interoperability.

================
File: docs/mcp-specs/specification/basic/versioning.md
================
---
title: Versioning
type: docs
weight: 80
---

The Model Context Protocol uses string-based version identifiers following the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, to indicate the last date backwards incompatible changes were made.

The current protocol version is **{{< param protocolRevision >}}**. [See all revisions]({{< ref "/specification/revisions" >}}).

{{< callout type="info" >}}
  The protocol version will _not_ be incremented when the protocol is updated, as long as the changes maintain backwards compatibility. This allows for incremental improvements while preserving interoperability.
{{< /callout >}}

Version negotiation happens during [initialization]({{< ref "/specification/basic/lifecycle#initialization" >}}). Clients and servers **MAY** support multiple protocol versions simultaneously, but they **MUST** agree on a single version to use for the session.

The protocol provides appropriate error handling if version negotiation fails, allowing clients to gracefully terminate connections when they cannot find a version compatible with the server.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for clients to expose filesystem "roots" to servers. Roots define the boundaries of where servers can operate within the filesystem, allowing them to understand which directories and files they have access to. Servers can request the list of roots from supporting clients and receive notifications when that list changes.

## User Interaction Model

Roots in MCP are typically exposed through workspace or project configuration interfaces.

For example, implementations could offer a workspace/project picker that allows users to select directories and files the server should have access to. This can be combined with automatic workspace detection from version control systems or project files.

However, implementations are free to expose roots through any interface pattern that suits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

## Capabilities

Clients that support prompts **MUST** declare the `roots` capability during [initialization]({{< ref "/specification/basic/lifecycle#initialization" >}}):

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "roots": {
      "listChanged": true
    }
  }
}
```

`listChanged` indicates whether the client will emit notifications when the list of roots changes.

## Protocol Messages

### Listing Roots

To retrieve roots, servers send a `roots/list` request:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "roots/list"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "roots": [
      {
        "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/myproject",
        "name": "My Project"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Root List Changes

When roots change, clients that support `listChanged` MUST send a notification:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/roots/list_changed"
}
```

## Message Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Server
    participant Client

    Note over Server,Client: Discovery
    Server->>Client: roots/list
    Client-->>Server: Available roots

    Note over Server,Client: Changes
    Client--)Server: notifications/roots/list_changed
    Server->>Client: roots/list
    Client-->>Server: Updated roots
```

## Data Types

### Root

A root definition includes:

- `uri`: Unique identifier for the root. This **MUST** be a `file://` URI in the current specification.
- `name`: Optional human-readable name for display purposes.

Example roots for different use cases:

#### Project Directory
```json
{
  "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/myproject",
  "name": "My Project"
}
```

#### Multiple Repositories
```json
[
  {
    "uri": "file:///home/user/repos/frontend",
    "name": "Frontend Repository"
  },
  {
    "uri": "file:///home/user/repos/backend",
    "name": "Backend Repository"
  }
]
```

## Error Handling

Clients SHOULD return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:

- Client does not support roots: `-32601` (Method not found)
- Internal errors: `-32603`

Example error:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "Roots not supported",
    "data": {
      "reason": "Client does not have roots capability"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. Clients **MUST**:
   - Only expose roots with appropriate permissions
   - Validate all root URIs to prevent path traversal
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Monitor root accessibility

2. Servers **SHOULD**:
   - Handle cases where roots become unavailable
   - Respect root boundaries during operations
   - Validate all paths against provided roots

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Clients **SHOULD**:
   - Prompt users for consent before exposing roots to servers
   - Provide clear user interfaces for root management
   - Validate root accessibility before exposing
   - Monitor for root changes

2. Servers **SHOULD**:
   - Check for roots capability before usage
   - Handle root list changes gracefully
   - Respect root boundaries in operations
   - Cache root information appropriately

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to request LLM sampling ("completions" or "generations") from language models via clients. This flow allows clients to maintain control over model access, selection, and permissions while enabling servers to leverage AI capabilities&mdash;with no server API keys necessary. Servers can request text or image-based interactions and optionally include context from MCP servers in their prompts.

## User Interaction Model

Sampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors, by enabling LLM calls to occur _nested_ inside other MCP server features.

Implementations are free to expose sampling through any interface pattern that suits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
  For trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always be a human in the loop with the ability to deny sampling requests.
  
  Applications **SHOULD**:
  * Provide UI that makes it easy and intuitive to review sampling requests
  * Allow users to view and edit prompts before sending
  * Present generated responses for review before delivery
{{< /callout >}}

## Capabilities

Clients that support sampling **MUST** declare the `sampling` capability during [initialization]({{< ref "/specification/basic/lifecycle#initialization" >}}):

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "sampling": {}
  }
}
```

## Protocol Messages

### Creating Messages

To request a language model generation, servers send a `sampling/createMessage` request:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "sampling/createMessage",
  "params": {
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What is the capital of France?"
        }
      }
    ],
    "modelPreferences": {
      "hints": [
        {
          "name": "claude-3-sonnet"
        }
      ],
      "intelligencePriority": 0.8,
      "speedPriority": 0.5
    },
    "systemPrompt": "You are a helpful assistant.",
    "maxTokens": 100
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "The capital of France is Paris."
    },
    "model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240307",
    "stopReason": "endTurn"
  }
}
```

## Message Flow

```

## Data Types

### Messages

Sampling messages can contain:

#### Text Content
```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "The message content"
}
```

#### Image Content
```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "data": "base64-encoded-image-data",
  "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
}
```

### Model Preferences

Model selection in MCP requires careful abstraction since servers and clients may use different AI providers with distinct model offerings. A server cannot simply request a specific model by name since the client may not have access to that exact model or may prefer to use a different provider's equivalent model.

To solve this, MCP implements a preference system that combines abstract capability priorities with optional model hints:

#### Capability Priorities

Servers express their needs through three normalized priority values (0-1):

- `costPriority`: How important is minimizing costs? Higher values prefer cheaper models.
- `speedPriority`: How important is low latency? Higher values prefer faster models.
- `intelligencePriority`: How important are advanced capabilities? Higher values prefer more capable models.

#### Model Hints

While priorities help select models based on characteristics, `hints` allow servers to suggest specific models or model families:

- Hints are treated as substrings that can match model names flexibly
- Multiple hints are evaluated in order of preference
- Clients **MAY** map hints to equivalent models from different providers
- Hints are advisory&mdash;clients make final model selection

For example:
```json
{
  "hints": [
    {"name": "claude-3-sonnet"},  // Prefer Sonnet-class models
    {"name": "claude"}            // Fall back to any Claude model
  ],
  "costPriority": 0.3,            // Cost is less important
  "speedPriority": 0.8,           // Speed is very important
  "intelligencePriority": 0.5     // Moderate capability needs
}
```

The client processes these preferences to select an appropriate model from its available options. For instance, if the client doesn't have access to Claude models but has Gemini, it might map the sonnet hint to `gemini-1.5-pro` based on similar capabilities.

## Error Handling

Clients **SHOULD** return errors for common failure cases:

Example error:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -1,
    "message": "User rejected sampling request"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. Clients **SHOULD** implement user approval controls
2. Both parties **SHOULD** validate message content
3. Clients **SHOULD** respect model preference hints
4. Clients **SHOULD** implement rate limiting
5. Both parties **MUST** handle sensitive data appropriately

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to offer argument autocompletion suggestions for prompts and resource URIs. This enables rich, IDE-like experiences where users receive contextual suggestions while entering argument values.

## User Interaction Model

Completion in MCP is designed to support interactive user experiences similar to IDE code completion.

For example, applications may show completion suggestions in a dropdown or popup menu as users type, with the ability to filter and select from available options.

However, implementations are free to expose completion through any interface pattern that suits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

## Protocol Messages

### Requesting Completions

To get completion suggestions, clients send a `completion/complete` request specifying what is being completed through a reference type:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "completion/complete",
  "params": {
    "ref": {
      "type": "ref/prompt",
      "name": "code_review"
    },
    "argument": {
      "name": "language",
      "value": "py"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "completion": {
      "values": ["python", "pytorch", "pyside"],
      "total": 10,
      "hasMore": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Reference Types

The protocol supports two types of completion references:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `ref/prompt` | References a prompt by name | `{"type": "ref/prompt", "name": "code_review"}` |
| `ref/resource` | References a resource URI | `{"type": "ref/resource", "uri": "file:///{path}"}` |

### Completion Results

Servers return an array of completion values ranked by relevance, with:

- Maximum 100 items per response
- Optional total number of available matches
- Boolean indicating if additional results exist

## Message Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Note over Client: User types argument
    Client->>Server: completion/complete
    Server-->>Client: Completion suggestions

    Note over Client: User continues typing
    Client->>Server: completion/complete
    Server-->>Client: Refined suggestions
```

## Data Types

### CompleteRequest
- `ref`: A `PromptReference` or `ResourceReference`
- `argument`: Object containing:
  - `name`: Argument name
  - `value`: Current value

### CompleteResult
- `completion`: Object containing:
  - `values`: Array of suggestions (max 100)
  - `total`: Optional total matches
  - `hasMore`: Additional results flag

## Implementation Considerations

1. Servers **SHOULD**:
   - Return suggestions sorted by relevance
   - Implement fuzzy matching where appropriate
   - Rate limit completion requests
   - Validate all inputs

2. Clients **SHOULD**:
   - Debounce rapid completion requests
   - Cache completion results where appropriate
   - Handle missing or partial results gracefully

## Security

Implementations **MUST**:
- Validate all completion inputs
- Implement appropriate rate limiting
- Control access to sensitive suggestions
- Prevent completion-based information disclosure

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to send structured log messages to clients. Clients can control logging verbosity by setting minimum log levels, with servers sending notifications containing severity levels, optional logger names, and arbitrary JSON-serializable data.

## User Interaction Model

Implementations are free to expose logging through any interface pattern that suits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

## Capabilities

Servers that emit log message notifications **MUST** declare the `logging` capability:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "logging": {}
  }
}
```

## Log Levels

The protocol follows the standard syslog severity levels specified in [RFC 5424](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424#section-6.2.1):

| Level      | Description                          | Example Use Case                        |
|------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| debug      | Detailed debugging information       | Function entry/exit points              |
| info       | General informational messages       | Operation progress updates              |
| notice     | Normal but significant events        | Configuration changes                   |
| warning    | Warning conditions                   | Deprecated feature usage                |
| error      | Error conditions                     | Operation failures                      |
| critical   | Critical conditions                  | System component failures               |
| alert      | Action must be taken immediately     | Data corruption detected                |
| emergency  | System is unusable                   | Complete system failure                 |

## Protocol Messages

### Setting Log Level

To configure the minimum log level, clients **MAY** send a `logging/setLevel` request:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "logging/setLevel",
  "params": {
    "level": "info"
  }
}
```

### Log Message Notifications

Servers send log messages using `notifications/message` notifications:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/message",
  "params": {
    "level": "error",
    "logger": "database",
    "data": {
      "error": "Connection failed",
      "details": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 5432
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Message Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Note over Client,Server: Configure Logging
    Client->>Server: logging/setLevel (info)
    Server-->>Client: Empty Result

    Note over Client,Server: Server Activity
    Server--)Client: notifications/message (info)
    Server--)Client: notifications/message (warning)
    Server--)Client: notifications/message (error)

    Note over Client,Server: Level Change
    Client->>Server: logging/setLevel (error)
    Server-->>Client: Empty Result
    Note over Server: Only sends error level<br/>and above
```

## Error Handling

Servers **SHOULD** return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:

- Invalid log level: `-32602` (Invalid params)
- Configuration errors: `-32603` (Internal error)

## Implementation Considerations

1. Servers **SHOULD**:
   - Rate limit log messages
   - Include relevant context in data field
   - Use consistent logger names
   - Remove sensitive information

2. Clients **MAY**:
   - Present log messages in the UI
   - Implement log filtering/search
   - Display severity visually
   - Persist log messages

## Security

1. Log messages **MUST NOT** contain:
   - Credentials or secrets
   - Personal identifying information
   - Internal system details that could aid attacks

2. Implementations **SHOULD**:
   - Rate limit messages
   - Validate all data fields
   - Control log access
   - Monitor for sensitive content

title: Pagination
---
{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) supports paginating list operations that may return large result sets. Pagination allows servers to yield results in smaller chunks rather than all at once.

Pagination is especially important when connecting to external services over the internet, but also useful for local integrations to avoid performance issues with large data sets.

## Pagination Model

Pagination in MCP uses an opaque cursor-based approach, instead of numbered pages.

* The **cursor** is an opaque string token, representing a position in the result set
* **Page size** is determined by the server, and **MAY NOT** be fixed

## Response Format

Pagination starts when the server sends a **response** that includes:
- The current page of results
- An optional `nextCursor` field if more results exist

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "123",
  "result": {
    "resources": [...],
    "nextCursor": "eyJwYWdlIjogM30="
  }
}
```

## Request Format

After receiving a cursor, the client can _continue_ paginating by issuing a request including that cursor:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "resources/list",
  "params": {
    "cursor": "eyJwYWdlIjogMn0="
  }
}
```

## Pagination Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: List Request (no cursor)
    loop Pagination Loop
      Server-->>Client: Page of results + nextCursor
      Client->>Server: List Request (with cursor)
    end
```

## Operations Supporting Pagination

The following MCP operations support pagination:

- `resources/list` - List available resources
- `resources/templates/list` - List resource templates
- `prompts/list` - List available prompts
- `tools/list` - List available tools

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Servers **SHOULD**:
   - Provide stable cursors
   - Handle invalid cursors gracefully

2. Clients **SHOULD**:
   - Treat a missing `nextCursor` as the end of results
   - Support both paginated and non-paginated flows

3. Clients **MUST** treat cursors as opaque tokens:
   - Don't make assumptions about cursor format
   - Don't attempt to parse or modify cursors
   - Don't persist cursors across sessions

## Error Handling

Invalid cursors **SHOULD** result in an error with code -32602 (Invalid params).

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

Servers provide the fundamental building blocks for adding context to language models via MCP. These primitives enable rich interactions between clients, servers, and language models:

- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates or instructions that guide language model interactions
- **Resources**: Structured data or content that provides additional context to the model
- **Tools**: Executable functions that allow models to perform actions or retrieve information

Each primitive can be summarized in the following control hierarchy:

| Primitive | Control                | Description                                        | Example                      |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Prompts   | User-controlled        | Interactive templates invoked by user choice       | Slash commands, menu options |
| Resources | Application-controlled | Contextual data attached and managed by the client | File contents, git history   |
| Tools     | Model-controlled       | Functions exposed to the LLM to take actions    | API POST requests, file writing   |

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to expose prompt templates to clients. Prompts allow servers to provide structured messages and instructions for interacting with language models. Clients can discover available prompts, retrieve their contents, and provide arguments to customize them.

## User Interaction Model

Prompts are designed to be **user-controlled**, meaning they are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the user being able to explicitly select them for use.

Typically, prompts would be triggered through user-initiated commands in the user interface, which allows users to naturally discover and invoke available prompts.

For example, as slash commands:

![Example of prompt exposed as slash command](slash-command.png)

However, implementors are free to expose prompts through any interface pattern that suits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

## Capabilities

Servers that support prompts **MUST** declare the `prompts` capability during [initialization]({{< ref "/specification/basic/lifecycle#initialization" >}}):
```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "prompts": {
      "listChanged": true
    }
  }
}
```

`listChanged` indicates whether the server will emit notifications when the list of available prompts changes.

## Protocol Messages

### Listing Prompts

To retrieve available prompts, clients send a `prompts/list` request. This operation supports [pagination]({{< ref "/specification/server/utilities/pagination" >}}).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "prompts/list",
  "params": {
    "cursor": "optional-cursor-value"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "prompts": [
      {
        "name": "code_review",
        "description": "Asks the LLM to analyze code quality and suggest improvements",
        "arguments": [
          {
            "name": "code",
            "description": "The code to review",
            "required": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "nextCursor": "next-page-cursor"
  }
}
```

### Getting a Prompt

To retrieve a specific prompt, clients send a `prompts/get` request. Arguments may be auto-completed through [the completion API]({{< ref "/specification/server/utilities/completion" >}}).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "prompts/get",
  "params": {
    "name": "code_review",
    "arguments": {
      "code": "def hello():\n    print('world')"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "description": "Code review prompt",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Please review this Python code:\ndef hello():\n    print('world')"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### List Changed Notification

When the list of available prompts changes, servers that declared the `listChanged` capability **SHOULD** send a notification:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/prompts/list_changed"
}
```

## Message Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Note over Client,Server: Discovery
    Client->>Server: prompts/list
    Server-->>Client: List of prompts

    Note over Client,Server: Usage
    Client->>Server: prompts/get
    Server-->>Client: Prompt content

    opt listChanged
      Note over Client,Server: Changes
      Server--)Client: prompts/list_changed
      Client->>Server: prompts/list
      Server-->>Client: Updated prompts
    end
```

## Data Types

### Prompt

A prompt definition includes:

- `name`: Unique identifier for the prompt
- `description`: Optional human-readable description
- `arguments`: Optional list of arguments for customization

### PromptMessage

Messages in a prompt can contain:

- `role`: Either "user" or "assistant" to indicate the speaker
- `content`: One of the following content types:

#### Text Content
Text content represents plain text messages:
```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "The text content of the message"
}
```
This is the most common content type used for natural language interactions.

#### Image Content
Image content allows including visual information in messages:
```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "data": "base64-encoded-image-data",
  "mimeType": "image/png"
}
```
The image data MUST be base64-encoded and include a valid MIME type. This enables multi-modal interactions where visual context is important.

#### Embedded Resources
Embedded resources allow referencing server-side resources directly in messages:
```json
{
  "type": "resource",
  "resource": {
    "uri": "resource://example",
    "mimeType": "text/plain",
    "text": "Resource content"
  }
}
```

Resources can contain either text or binary (blob) data and MUST include:
- A valid resource URI
- The appropriate MIME type
- Either text content or base64-encoded blob data

Embedded resources enable prompts to seamlessly incorporate server-managed content like documentation, code samples, or other reference materials directly into the conversation flow.

## Error Handling

Servers SHOULD return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:

- Invalid prompt name: `-32602` (Invalid params)
- Missing required arguments: `-32602` (Invalid params)
- Internal errors: `-32603` (Internal error)

## Implementation Considerations

1. Servers **SHOULD** validate prompt arguments before processing
2. Clients **SHOULD** handle pagination for large prompt lists
3. Both parties **SHOULD** respect capability negotiation

## Security

Implementations **MUST** carefully validate all prompt inputs and outputs to prevent injection attacks or unauthorized access to resources.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to expose resources to clients. Resources allow servers to share data that provides context to language models, such as files, database schemas, or application-specific information. Each resource is uniquely identified by a [URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986).

## User Interaction Model

Resources in MCP are designed to be **application-driven**, with host applications determining how to incorporate context based on their needs.

For example, applications could:
* Expose resources through UI elements for explicit selection, in a tree or list view
* Allow the user to search through and filter available resources
* Implement automatic context inclusion, based on heuristics or the AI model's selection

![Example of resource context picker](resource-picker.png)

However, implementations are free to expose resources through any interface pattern that suits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

## Capabilities

Servers that support resources **MUST** declare the `resources` capability:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "resources": {
      "subscribe": true,
      "listChanged": true
    }
  }
}
```

The capability supports two optional features:
- `subscribe`: whether the client can subscribe to be notified of changes to individual resources.
- `listChanged`: whether the server will emit notifications when the list of available resources changes.

Both `subscribe` and `listChanged` are optional&mdash;servers can support neither, either, or both:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "resources": {}  // Neither feature supported
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "resources": {
      "subscribe": true  // Only subscriptions supported
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "resources": {
      "listChanged": true  // Only list change notifications supported
    }
  }
}
```

## Protocol Messages

### Listing Resources

To discover available resources, clients send a `resources/list` request. This operation supports [pagination]({{< ref "/specification/server/utilities/pagination" >}}).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "resources/list",
  "params": {
    "cursor": "optional-cursor-value"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "resources": [
      {
        "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs",
        "name": "main.rs",
        "description": "Primary application entry point",
        "mimeType": "text/x-rust"
      }
    ],
    "nextCursor": "next-page-cursor"
  }
}
```

### Reading Resources

To retrieve resource contents, clients send a `resources/read` request:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "resources/read",
  "params": {
    "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "contents": [
      {
        "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs",
        "mimeType": "text/x-rust",
        "text": "fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello world!\");\n}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Resource Templates

Resource templates allow servers to expose parameterized resources using [URI templates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6570). Arguments may be auto-completed through [the completion API]({{< ref "/specification/server/utilities/completion" >}}).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "method": "resources/templates/list"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "result": {
    "resourceTemplates": [
      {
        "uriTemplate": "file:///{path}",
        "name": "Project Files",
        "description": "Access files in the project directory",
        "mimeType": "application/octet-stream"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### List Changed Notification

When the list of available resources changes, servers that declared the `listChanged` capability **SHOULD** send a notification:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/resources/list_changed"
}
```

### Subscriptions

The protocol supports optional subscriptions to resource changes. Clients can subscribe to specific resources and receive notifications when they change:

**Subscribe Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 4,
  "method": "resources/subscribe",
  "params": {
    "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs"
  }
}
```

**Update Notification:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/resources/updated",
  "params": {
    "uri": "file:///project/src/main.rs"
  }
}
```

## Message Flow

    Note over Client,Server: Updates
    Server--)Client: notifications/resources/updated
    Client->>Server: resources/read
    Server-->>Client: Updated contents
```

## Data Types

### Resource

A resource definition includes:

- `uri`: Unique identifier for the resource
- `name`: Human-readable name
- `description`: Optional description
- `mimeType`: Optional MIME type

### Resource Contents

Resources can contain either text or binary data:

#### Text Content
```json
{
  "uri": "file:///example.txt",
  "mimeType": "text/plain",
  "text": "Resource content"
}
```

#### Binary Content
```json
{
  "uri": "file:///example.png",
  "mimeType": "image/png",
  "blob": "base64-encoded-data"
}
```

## Common URI Schemes

The protocol defines several standard URI schemes. This list not exhaustive&mdash;implementations are always free to use additional, custom URI schemes.

### https://

Used to represent a resource available on the web.

Servers **SHOULD** use this scheme only when the client is able to fetch and load the resource directly from the web on its own—that is, it doesn’t need to read the resource via the MCP server.

For other use cases, servers **SHOULD** prefer to use another URI scheme, or define a custom one, even if the server will itself be downloading resource contents over the internet.

### file://

Used to identify resources that behave like a filesystem. However, the resources do not need to map to an actual physical filesystem.

MCP servers **MAY** identify file:// resources with an [XDG MIME type](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/0.14/ar01s02.html#id-1.3.14), like `inode/directory`, to represent non-regular files (such as directories) that don’t otherwise have a standard MIME type.

### git://

Git version control integration.

## Error Handling

Servers SHOULD return standard JSON-RPC errors for common failure cases:

- Resource not found: `-32002`
- Internal errors: `-32603`

Example error:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 5,
  "error": {
    "code": -32002,
    "message": "Resource not found",
    "data": {
      "uri": "file:///nonexistent.txt"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. Servers **MUST** validate all resource URIs
2. Access controls **SHOULD** be implemented for sensitive resources
3. Binary data **MUST** be properly encoded
4. Resource permissions **SHOULD** be checked before operations

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows servers to expose tools that can be invoked by language models. Tools enable models to interact with external systems, such as querying databases, calling APIs, or performing computations. Each tool is uniquely identified by a name and includes metadata describing its schema.

## User Interaction Model

Tools in MCP are designed to be **model-controlled**, meaning that the language model can discover and invoke tools automatically based on its contextual understanding and the user's prompts.

However, implementations are free to expose tools through any interface pattern that suits their needs&mdash;the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
  For trust & safety and security, there **SHOULD** always be a human in the loop with the ability to deny tool invocations.
  
  Applications **SHOULD**:
  * Provide UI that makes clear which tools are being exposed to the AI model
  * Insert clear visual indicators when tools are invoked
  * Present confirmation prompts to the user for operations, to ensure a human is in the loop
{{< /callout >}}

## Capabilities

Servers that support tools **MUST** declare the `tools` capability:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": {
      "listChanged": true
    }
  }
}
```

`listChanged` indicates whether the server will emit notifications when the list of available tools changes.

## Protocol Messages

### Listing Tools

To discover available tools, clients send a `tools/list` request. This operation supports [pagination]({{< ref "/specification/server/utilities/pagination" >}}).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/list",
  "params": {
    "cursor": "optional-cursor-value"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather information for a location",
        "inputSchema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "City name or zip code"
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    ],
    "nextCursor": "next-page-cursor"
  }
}
```

### Calling Tools

To invoke a tool, clients send a `tools/call` request:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": {
      "location": "New York"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "content": [{
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Current weather in New York:\nTemperature: 72°F\nConditions: Partly cloudy"
    }],
    "isError": false
  }
}
```

### List Changed Notification

When the list of available tools changes, servers that declared the `listChanged` capability **SHOULD** send a notification:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/tools/list_changed"
}
```

## Message Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant LLM
    participant Client
    participant Server

    Note over Client,Server: Discovery
    Client->>Server: tools/list
    Server-->>Client: List of tools

    Note over Client,Server: Updates
    Server--)Client: tools/list_changed
    Client->>Server: tools/list
    Server-->>Client: Updated tools
```

## Data Types

### Tool

A tool definition includes:

- `name`: Unique identifier for the tool
- `description`: Human-readable description of functionality
- `inputSchema`: JSON Schema defining expected parameters

### Tool Result

Tool results can contain multiple content items of different types:

#### Text Content
```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "text": "Tool result text"
}
```

#### Image Content
```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "data": "base64-encoded-data",
  "mimeType": "image/png"
}
```

#### Embedded Resources

[Resources]({{< ref "/specification/server/resources" >}}) **MAY** be embedded, to provide additional context or data, behind a URI that can be subscribed to or fetched again by the client later:

```json
{
  "type": "resource",
  "resource": {
    "uri": "resource://example",
    "mimeType": "text/plain",
    "text": "Resource content"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Tools use two error reporting mechanisms:

1. **Protocol Errors**: Standard JSON-RPC errors for issues like:
   - Unknown tools
   - Invalid arguments
   - Server errors

2. **Tool Execution Errors**: Reported in tool results with `isError: true`:
   - API failures
   - Invalid input data
   - Business logic errors

Example protocol error:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 3,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Unknown tool: invalid_tool_name"
  }
}
```

Example tool execution error:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 4,
  "result": {
    "content": [{
      "type": "text",
      "text": "Failed to fetch weather data: API rate limit exceeded"
    }],
    "isError": true
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. Servers **MUST**:
   - Validate all tool inputs
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Rate limit tool invocations
   - Sanitize tool outputs

2. Clients **SHOULD**:
   - Prompt for user confirmation on sensitive operations
   - Show tool inputs to the user before calling the server, to avoid malicious or accidental data exfiltration
   - Validate tool results before passing to LLM
   - Implement timeouts for tool calls
   - Log tool usage for audit purposes

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Protocol Revision**: {{< param protocolRevision >}}
{{< /callout >}}

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

This specification defines the authoritative protocol requirements, based on the TypeScript schema in [schema.ts](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/schema.ts).

For implementation guides and examples, visit [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## Overview

MCP provides a standardized way for applications to:

- Share contextual information with language models
- Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems
- Build composable integrations and workflows

The protocol uses [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) 2.0 messages to establish communication between:

- **Hosts**: LLM applications that initiate connections
- **Clients**: Connectors within the host application
- **Servers**: Services that provide context and capabilities

MCP takes some inspiration from the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), which standardizes how to add support for programming languages across a whole ecosystem of development tools. In a similar way, MCP standardizes how to integrate additional context and tools into the ecosystem of AI applications.

## Key Details

### Base Protocol
- [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/) message format
- Stateful connections
- Server and client capability negotiation

### Features

Servers offer any of the following features to clients:

- **Resources**: Context and data, for the user or the AI model to use
- **Prompts**: Templated messages and workflows for users
- **Tools**: Functions for the AI model to execute

Clients may offer the following feature to servers:

- **Sampling**: Server-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions

### Additional Utilities

- Configuration
- Progress tracking
- Cancellation
- Error reporting
- Logging

## Security and Trust & Safety

The Model Context Protocol enables powerful capabilities through arbitrary data access and code execution paths. With this power comes important security and trust considerations that all implementors must carefully address.

### Key Principles

1. **User Consent and Control**
   - Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations
   - Users must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken
   - Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers
   - Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent
   - User data should be protected with appropriate access controls

3. **Tool Safety**
   - Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate caution
   - Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool
   - Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use

4. **LLM Sampling Controls**
   - Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests
   - Users should control:
     - Whether sampling occurs at all
     - The actual prompt that will be sent
     - What results the server can see
   - The protocol intentionally limits server visibility into prompts

### Implementation Guidelines

While MCP itself cannot enforce these security principles at the protocol level, implementors **SHOULD**:

1. Build robust consent and authorization flows into their applications
2. Provide clear documentation of security implications
3. Implement appropriate access controls and data protections
4. Follow security best practices in their integrations
5. Consider privacy implications in their feature designs

# My MCP Server MCP Server

A custom MCP server

This is a TypeScript-based MCP server that implements a simple notes system. It demonstrates core MCP concepts by providing:

- Resources representing text notes with URIs and metadata
- Tools for creating new notes
- Prompts for generating summaries of notes

## Features

### Resources
- List and access notes via `note://` URIs
- Each note has a title, content and metadata
- Plain text mime type for simple content access

### Tools
- `create_note` - Create new text notes
  - Takes title and content as required parameters
  - Stores note in server state

### Prompts
- `summarize_notes` - Generate a summary of all stored notes
  - Includes all note contents as embedded resources
  - Returns structured prompt for LLM summarization

## Development

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

For development with auto-rebuild:
```bash
npm run watch
```

## Installation

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "My MCP Server": {
      "command": "/path/to/My MCP Server/build/index.js"
    }
  }
}
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
