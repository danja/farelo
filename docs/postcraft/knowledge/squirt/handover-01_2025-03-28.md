Great! The application is running on port 9001. Let's explain the key new features we've implemented:

  1. RDF Metadata Extraction: We created functionality in rdf-extractor.js to extract metadata from web pages including
  titles, descriptions, images, tags, authors, and more. This uses a combination of Open Graph, Twitter cards,
  schema.org, and other metadata formats.
  2. Link Preview Feature: When users add a URL in the "Link" post form, they can click "Extract Metadata" to
  automatically:
    - Fetch and parse the webpage
    - Extract key metadata
    - Display a visual preview card with image, title, and description
    - Auto-fill form fields with extracted data
    - Convert the metadata to an RDF dataset
  3. Enhanced Form Field Handling: The application now dynamically updates form fields based on post type and handles
  metadata extraction with visual feedback.
  4. Enhanced UI: We added a link preview card with responsive design that shows extracted metadata including images from
   web pages.

  These features significantly enhance the link sharing capabilities, making it easier for users to quickly share and
  store information from web pages while preserving rich metadata.

  To try the application, you can open http://localhost:9001/ in a browser. When creating a new link post, you can enter
  a URL and use the "Extract Metadata" button to automatically fill in details from the webpage and see a preview of how
  the link will appear.

  The application is now a functional Progressive Web App with local storage, rich metadata extraction, and SPARQL
  endpoint integration for persistence.
