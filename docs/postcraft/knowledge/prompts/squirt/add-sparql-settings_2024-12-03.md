In your project knowledge, `squirt_repomix.txt` is the first pass at implementing the requirements in `requirements_2024-12-03.md`, see `handover_2024-12-03.md` for notes. It builds & launches ok, visually adequate for now. Now would you please make and integrate the required `Settings` page. To start, this should include a block in which to add and remove SPARQL endpoints (more settings will be added later). The values in this should be stored in the RDF dataset `settings`, which will be saved to/loaded from localstorage.
